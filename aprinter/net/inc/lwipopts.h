//   the buffer is a continuation of the previous buffer and extends
//   an existing pbuf instead of allocating a new one, when possible.
//   The magic number in this define is based on the fact these REF
//   pbufs always appear as part of TCP segments together with a header
//   pbuf; usually we have a single REF pbuf following a header, except
//   at buffer wrap-around we may have one extra REF pbuf.
