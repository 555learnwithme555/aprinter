 * Macro for easily locking a mutex.
 * 
 * This creates a Lock object with ThisContext=decltype(this_context)
 * but with Lock=decltype((this_context)). As a result it can be used
 * both with lvalue mutexes and temporary dummy mutex objects:
 * 
 * 1. MyMutexType mutex; APRINTER_LOCK(mutex, ...) { ...}
 *    In this case the Lock's Mutex tupe will be MyMutexType&
 *    and the lock will store a reference to the mutex.
 * 
 * 2. APRINTER_LOCK(InterruptLock(), ...) { ... }
 *    In this case the Lock's Mutex type will be InterruptLock
 *    and the lock will store an InterruptLock object by value
 *    (presumably an empty class).
 * 
 * WARNING: Currently the user-specified body after the macro becomes the
 * body of a for-loop. Therefore break or continue must not be used within
 * the lock body. This might be fixed in the future with C++17 if-initializers.
 * 
 * \param mutex The mutex to lock.
 * \param this_context The context outside the lock.
 * \param lock_context Variable name for the context inside the lock.
